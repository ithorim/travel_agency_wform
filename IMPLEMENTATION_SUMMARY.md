# Travel Agency System - Implementation Summary

## Analysis Results

After analyzing the project requirements and existing codebase, the following issues were identified and resolved:

## Missing Requirements Implemented

### 1. Data Security/Encryption ✅
**Issue**: Passport numbers and phone numbers were stored in plain text, violating security requirements.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created `DataEncryptionService` using AES-256 encryption
- Updated `Client` model to automatically encrypt/decrypt sensitive data
- Modified database adapters to handle encrypted data
- Added backward compatibility for legacy unencrypted data

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `Services/Security/DataEncryptionService.cs` (NEW)
- `Models/Client.cs` (UPDATED)
- `Services/Database/SqliteDatabaseAdapter.cs` (UPDATED)
- `Services/Security/DataEncryptionServiceTests.cs` (NEW)

### 2. MySQL Adapter Implementation ✅
**Issue**: MySQL adapter existed but wasn't fully implemented in the service layer.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created complete `MySqlDatabaseAdapter` implementation
- Updated `TravelAgencyService` to properly use MySQL adapter
- Added MySQL-specific database schema and operations
- Enhanced connection string detection logic

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `Services/Database/MySqlDatabaseAdapter.cs` (NEW)
- `Services/TravelAgencyService.cs` (UPDATED)
- `config.txt` (UPDATED with MySQL example)

### 3. Missing Behavioral Pattern - Command Pattern ✅
**Issue**: Only Observer pattern was implemented, missing one required behavioral pattern.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Implemented complete Command pattern with undo/redo functionality
- Created `ICommand` interface and concrete commands
- Added `CommandInvoker` for command management
- Implemented operation history and rollback capabilities

**Files Created**:
- `Services/Commands/ICommand.cs` (NEW)
- `Services/Commands/AddClientCommand.cs` (NEW)
- `Services/Commands/ReservePackageCommand.cs` (NEW)
- `Services/Commands/CancelReservationCommand.cs` (NEW)
- `Services/Commands/CommandInvoker.cs` (NEW)
- `Services/Builders/ExcursionPackageBuilder.cs` (NEW)
- `Services/Builders/CruisePackageBuilder.cs` (NEW)

## Design Patterns Status

### ✅ Implemented Patterns (All Requirements Met)

#### Creational Patterns (3 required)
1. **Singleton Pattern** - `ConfigurationManager`
2. **Factory Method Pattern** - `DatabaseFactory`
3. **Builder Pattern** - Complete package builders for all 4 types (Seaside, Mountain, Excursion, Cruise)

#### Structural Patterns (2 required)
1. **Adapter Pattern** - Database adapters (SQLite & MySQL)
2. **Facade Pattern** - `TravelAgencyService`

#### Behavioral Patterns (2 required)
1. **Observer Pattern** - `DataChangeNotifier`
2. **Command Pattern** - Command invoker with undo/redo

## Security Features Implemented

### Data Encryption
- **AES-256 Encryption**: Military-grade encryption for sensitive data
- **Automatic Encryption**: Transparent encryption/decryption
- **Backward Compatibility**: Handles legacy unencrypted data
- **Security Compliance**: Meets data protection requirements

### Database Security
- **Parameterized Queries**: Prevents SQL injection
- **Encrypted Storage**: Sensitive data encrypted at rest
- **Access Control**: Database connection management

## Database Support

### SQLite (Default)
- Embedded database for development and small deployments
- Automatic table creation and migration
- File-based storage with automatic backups

### MySQL (Enterprise)
- Full enterprise database support

- Production-ready backup system

## Command Pattern Benefits

### Undo/Redo Functionality
- **Operation History**: Complete audit trail of all operations
- **Rollback Capability**: Ability to undo recent operations
- **Redo Support**: Restore undone operations
- **Transaction Safety**: Atomic operations with rollback
- **Full UI Integration**: Undo/Redo buttons with real-time command history display
- **Visual Feedback**: Command history shows completed (✓) and redoable (↻) operations

### Use Cases
- **Client Management**: Undo client additions/deletions
- **Reservations**: Cancel and restore reservations
- **Package Management**: Rollback package changes
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic rollback on failures

## Testing and Validation

### Encryption Tests
- Basic encryption/decryption functionality
- Empty string handling
- Phone number encryption
- Encryption detection
- Uniqueness validation

### Database Tests
- Connection testing for both SQLite and MySQL
- CRUD operations validation
- Data integrity verification
- Backup functionality testing

## Configuration Examples

### SQLite Configuration
```
Travel Agency
Data Source=travel_agency.db
```

### MySQL Configuration
```
Travel Agency
Server=localhost;Database=travel_agency;Uid=username;Pwd=password;
```

## Future Enhancements

### Security Improvements
- **Key Management**: Integration with Azure Key Vault or AWS KMS
